# RADN
[CVPRW 2021] Code for Region-Adaptive Deformable Network for Image Quality Assessment

[[Paper on arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11599)

## Overview

## Update
[2021/5/7] add codes for WResNet (our baseline).

[2021/5/29] add codes for RADN.
## Instruction
1. run `mkdir.sh` to create necessary directories.

2. use `sh train.sh` or `sh test.sh` to train or test the model. You can also change the options in the shell files as you like.

The pretrained models can be found at this [URL](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yxHPDDOHH7zmJ_cu1p_gk0yJ6Bo5qtn5/view?usp=sharing).

Please note that the performance on the challenge leaderboard is obtained by ensembling and the checkpoint above is for the single model.

Note: Due to the instability of deformable convolution and self-attention in training, if there exist some problems during the training of RADN, donâ€™t worry, you can try to load baseline weights to initialize RADN to achieve stable training and rapid convergence.

## Acknowledgment
The codes borrow heavily from WaDIQaM implemented by [Dingquan Li](https://github.com/lidq92/WaDIQaM) and we really appreciate it.
